# OpenCode Drive

Use `opencode-drive` to launch an isolated OpenCode instance and control its TUI and simulated LLM.

Default to a one-shot Effect program. Use `defineScript` for named, visible,
restartable, or manual-launch workflows; it is also Effect-only. Use live
commands only for interactive development against a persistent or visible
instance.

## Catalog State IDs

Browse and copy OpenCode terminal state IDs from:

```text
https://dev.opencode.ai/lab/catalog
```

Replayable flow states expose canonical `<flow-id>/<state-id>` addresses, for example:

```text
patch-success-lifecycle/permission-prompt
```

Reproduce one from an `opencode-drive` source checkout:

```bash
bun run catalog:reproduce -- patch-success-lifecycle/permission-prompt \
  --opencode /path/to/opencode \
  --output /tmp/permission-prompt.frame.json
```

The command executes the registered recipe only through that checkpoint and writes an `opencode-terminal-frame-v1` artifact. Only flows in `apps/catalog/scenarios/index.ts` are replayable. Browse-only flows and screen cards copy standalone capture IDs instead; do not invent a flow prefix. Use a protocol-compatible OpenCode checkout, ideally the source revision shown by the selected capture set.

To compare a committed local OpenCode branch against current v2 across every catalog state:

```bash
bun run catalog:capture -- \
  --opencode /path/to/opencode \
  --revision origin/v2 \
  --revision HEAD
```

Add repeated `--theme` flags to capture the same commit pair under multiple themes. Capture resolves detached immutable worktrees, retains earlier sets, and sorts sets by commit time. Uncommitted changes are excluded by design.

## Effect Programs

Write `drive.ts` as a default-exported, fully provided Effect, then run it directly:

```ts
import { Effect } from "effect"
import { Llm, OpenCodeDriver } from "opencode-drive"

export default OpenCodeDriver.use(
  {
    project: {
      git: true,
      files: {
        "src/value.ts": "export const value = 1\n",
      },
    },
  },
  ({ ui, llm }) =>
    Effect.gen(function* () {
      yield* llm.queue(Llm.text("The value is 1."))
      yield* ui.submit("Read src/value.ts")
      yield* ui.waitFor("The value is 1.")
      yield* ui.screenshot("result")
    }),
)
```

```bash
opencode-drive run ./drive.ts
```

`run` type-checks the module before importing it and requires its default export to be an `Effect<unknown, unknown, never>`. It accepts exactly one module path; it does not accept `--command.*` flags or application arguments after `--`.

`OpenCodeDriver.use` is the normal lifecycle boundary. It creates an isolated project, starts the server and primary TUI, races the program against backend failure, settles queued LLM work, closes all TUIs, exports recordings, and removes the artifact directory unless `keepArtifacts: true` is set. Settlement failures fail the program.

Use `OpenCodeDriver.make` only when explicit settlement is necessary. It requires a scope, and the program must call `driver.settle()` before leaving that scope.

### Deterministic Project DSL

Declare the project, semantic OpenCode configuration, and TUI configuration in `OpenCodeDriver.use` options:

```ts
export default OpenCodeDriver.use(
  {
    project: {
      git: true,
      files: { "README.md": "# Fixture\n" },
    },
    config: {
      autoupdate: false,
      username: "Drive",
    },
    tuiConfig: {
      theme: "system",
      scroll_speed: 1,
    },
    setup: ({ fs, config, tuiConfig }) =>
      Effect.gen(function* () {
        yield* fs.writeFile("src/setup.ts", "export const ready = true\n")
        config.username = "Setup wins"
        tuiConfig.scroll_speed = 2
      }),
  },
  ({ ui }) => ui.screenshot("home"),
)
```

The DSL is applied in this order:

1. `project.files` is written into the isolated project.
2. `config` and `tuiConfig` are deeply merged over `.opencode/opencode.jsonc` and `.opencode/tui.jsonc` fixture values. Objects merge recursively; arrays and scalar values replace existing values.
3. `setup` runs and may write project files or mutate the merged `config` and `tuiConfig` objects. Its mutations take final precedence.
4. Drive writes both configs as stable, formatted JSON. With `project.git: true`, it creates a repository and commits the complete pre-launch state with fixed Git identity and timestamps.

`fs.writeFile` is rooted inside the simulated project and creates parent directories. `project.git: true` refuses to replace existing Git metadata; omit it when prepared fixtures already include a repository.

### UI And LLM

UI operations are Effects:

- `ui.submit(text)` types and presses Enter.
- `ui.state()`, `ui.capture()`, and `ui.matches(text)` inspect the terminal. `ui.capture()` returns the raw terminal frame as data.
- `ui.snapshot()` returns the versioned semantic tree; `ui.getNode(query, options?)` polls for one exact semantic match.
- `ui.waitFor(textOrPredicate, options?)` polls until a match.
- `ui.getElement(query, options?)`, `ui.focus(...)`, and `ui.click(...)` target interactive elements.
- `ui.screenshot(name?)` asks OpenCode for the raw frame, saves it as a PNG inside Drive, and returns its absolute path. It requires no media-directory configuration.
- `ui.resize({ cols, rows })`, `ui.press(...)`, and `ui.arrow(...)` control the TUI.

Build deterministic simulated responses with the `Llm` namespace and schedule them through the driver's `llm` controller:

```ts
yield* llm.queue(
  Llm.reasoning("Checking the fixture"),
  Llm.pause(20),
  Llm.text("The value is 1.", { delay: 2, chunkSize: 15 }),
)
```

`llm.queue(...)` declares the next response without waiting. `llm.send(...)`
waits for the next request and completes its response. For ongoing responses,
the handler passed to `llm.serve` returns an Effect `Stream`; registering the
handler is an Effect. Available outputs include `text`, `reasoning`, `pause`,
`toolCall`, `raw`, `finish`, and `disconnect`; a normal response gets
`finish("stop")` when no terminal output is supplied.

```ts
import { Stream } from "effect"
import { Llm } from "opencode-drive"

yield* llm.serve((_request, index) =>
  Stream.make(Llm.text(`Response ${index + 1}`)),
)
```

Use the capability names literally: `opencode` is the generated OpenCode SDK,
`tui` is the primary frontend process, `ui` is `tui.ui`, and `tuis` launches
additional frontend processes.

Additional TUIs share the server and LLM controller:

```ts
const secondary = yield* tuis.launch({
  viewport: { cols: 120, rows: 40 },
  recording: true,
})
yield* secondary.ui.screenshot("secondary")
```

### Annotated Recordings

With `tui: { recording: true }`, label moments during the run and the exported
MP4 gets a burned-in footer (segment label bottom-left, elapsed timecode and
"drive" branding bottom-right):

```ts
yield* tui.recording.mark("typing a prompt — 600ms wire latency")
// ... drive the UI ...
yield* tui.recording.mark("") // clears the label
const video = yield* tui.recording.finish()
```

For programmatic exports, `exportRecording` accepts `annotations` (labelled
raw-timeline instants), `clips` (`{ fromMs, toMs, speed?, holdMs?, label? }`
segments that trim/re-speed/freeze, concatenated in order), and `footer`
(`false` suppresses it; `{ brand }` overrides the branding). See
`test/manual/tui-regressions/optimistic-create-demo.ts` for a complete
before/after demo recording script.

### Network Chaos

Set `network: true` in `defineScript` to route every TUI through a chaos TCP
proxy (the TUI is pinned with `--server`, so reconnects always cross the
proxy). The Drive control plane and the `opencode` SDK stay clean; only the
TUI's HTTP and SSE traffic degrades.

```ts
export default defineScript({
  network: true,
  run: ({ ui, network }) =>
    Effect.gen(function* () {
      yield* network.set({ latencyMs: 400, jitterMs: 200 })
      yield* network.set({ blackhole: true }) // buffer all bytes until clear
      yield* network.set({ refuseNew: true }) // refuse new connections
      yield* network.killConnections() // drop every open connection
      yield* network.clear() // heal; buffered bytes flush
    }),
})
```

A quiet blackhole does not raise the TUI's reconnect overlay; that needs a
dropped connection (`killConnections`) while traffic is pending.

### Script-Writing Rules Of Thumb

- Timeout severity is split: `UiWaitTimeoutError` (a `waitFor`/`getElement`/
  `getNode` deadline passed) is catchable — branch on "did X appear in time?"
  with `Effect.catchTag("UiWaitTimeoutError", ...)`. `UiTimeoutError` (an
  unanswered UI RPC) aborts the whole run even when caught.
- LLM request bodies carry the entire conversation. Route reply markers by
  which appears **last** in the serialized body (`lastIndexOf`), never by the
  first `includes` hit.
- The server projection (`opencode.message.list`) is the ground truth for
  whether a prompt landed. The screen and the instance's
  `prompt-history.jsonl` can both mislead.
- `ctrl+c` on an empty composer exits the TUI and kills the run
  (`RpcClientDefect: connection closed`); use `ctrl+u` to clear leftover
  composer text.
- Effect v4: it is `Effect.catch`, not `Effect.catchAll`.
- Isolated-instance state lives under `$artifacts/home/...`; screenshots land
  under the run's `output/.../generation-N/` directory.
- Set `OPENCODE_DRIVE_MEDIA_DIR=$PWD/.drive-output` (gitignored) when running
  probes from an agent: the default media root sits under the system tmpdir
  with a per-run id in the path, so every run triggers a fresh
  outside-the-project permission prompt.
- Interrupting a busy session takes **two** escape presses within 5 seconds
  (the first arms, the second fires `session.interrupt`). A single
  `ui.press("escape")` is a no-op for interruption.
- `server.kill()` mid-stream abandons the in-flight served reply (a deliberate
  detach, not a run failure); `server.launch()` attaches the LLM stub to the
  replacement service. Pass `OPENCODE_DRIVE_DB=...` so both generations share
  a database.

### Reports And Paths

`OpenCodeDriver` exports a branded `AbsolutePath` schema and a compact `RunReport` containing the artifact root, retention, recording paths, and endpoint compatibility. It also exports `decodeAbsolutePath` and `decodeRunReport` for validating unknown values.

`driver.settle()` returns the report with its recording paths. Use `OpenCodeDriver.useReport(options, run)` when a safe lifecycle program also needs the report alongside its result.

Drive prefers protocol negotiation and reports explicit legacy fallback. Set `opencode.compatibility` to `"required"` when protocol skew must fail before the program runs. Additional built-in tool adapters remain follow-ups.

### Arbitrary Dynamic Tools

Use runtime `tools.attach` for tools that do not have a shipped Drive adapter.
Attachment replaces the complete dynamic set without affecting configured
static adapters. Take invocations by the model call ID, while Drive owns
producer IDs, progress sequences, reconnect replay, and exactly-one terminal
commitment.

```ts
yield* tools.attach({
  tools: [
    {
      name: "lookup",
      description: "Look up a value",
      inputSchema: {
        type: "object",
        properties: { query: { type: "string" } },
        required: ["query"],
      },
      options: { codemode: false },
    },
  ],
})

const lookup = yield* tools.take("call_lookup")
yield* lookup.progress({ structured: { phase: "searching" } })
yield* lookup.finish({
  structured: { answer: 42 },
  content: [{ type: "text", text: "42" }],
})
```

Use `awaitCancelled()` to observe native interruption. Do not synthesize
cancellation or expose transport sequence numbers. Dynamic effective names may
not collide with configured `shell`, `webfetch`, or `websearch` adapters.

### Simulated Shell Execution

Declare the built-in tools Drive should intercept, then control each invocation
from the running program. Unregistered tools remain real. Calls may be accepted
in arrival order or by the stable ID supplied in `Llm.toolCall`, so parallel
invocations can progress and settle independently.

```ts
import { Effect } from "effect"
import { Llm, OpenCodeDriver } from "opencode-drive"

export default OpenCodeDriver.use({ tools: ["shell"] }, ({ tools, llm, ui }) =>
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const shells = yield* tools.control("shell")
    yield* llm.queue(
      Llm.toolCall({
        index: 0,
        id: "call_shell",
        name: "shell",
        input: { command: "compile" },
      }),
      Llm.finish("tool-calls"),
    )
    yield* ui.submit("Compile the project")
    const shell = yield* shells.take("call_shell")
    yield* shell.progress(`Running ${shell.input.command}\n`)
    yield* shell.succeed({ output: "Controlled success\n", exit: 0 })
  }),
)
```

The same declaration and runtime `tools` capability are available in
`defineScript`. Supported adapters are `shell`, `webfetch`, and `websearch`.
Each progress value replaces the visible tool output, so send accumulated text
when earlier lines should remain visible. Calls settle exactly once;
`awaitInterrupted()` observes session interruption or transport disconnection.

The callback form remains available for fixed behavior that does not need
runtime orchestration:

```ts
import { Effect } from "effect"
import { Tool } from "opencode-drive"

const tools = (registry: Tool.Registry) => {
  registry.handle("shell", ({ input, progress }) =>
    Effect.gen(function* () {
      yield* progress(`Running ${input.command}\n`)
      return { output: "Controlled success\n", exit: 0 }
    }),
  )
}
```

Foreground callback handler Effects are interrupted when OpenCode interrupts
the session, the transport disconnects, or Drive shuts down. Detached
background shell handlers continue after their launch response and are
interrupted when Drive shuts down.

## Effect Scripts

Use `defineScript` with `start --script` when the workflow must have a stable
instance name, be visible, rerun on `restart`, or explicitly launch and kill
its server and TUIs. `setup` and `run` return Effects. Operations on `fs`,
`ui`, `llm`, `tools`, `server`, and `tuis` also return Effects; there is no
Promise API or compatibility shim.

```ts
import { Effect } from "effect"
import { defineScript, Llm } from "opencode-drive"

export default defineScript({
  config: { autoupdate: false },
  tuiConfig: { theme: "system" },
  project: {
    git: true,
    files: { "src/value.ts": "export const value = 1\n" },
  },
  run: ({ ui, llm }) =>
    Effect.gen(function* () {
      yield* llm.queue(Llm.text("The value is 1."))
      yield* ui.submit("Read src/value.ts")
      yield* ui.waitFor("The value is 1.")
    }),
})
```

Always type-check a script before starting it:

```bash
opencode-drive check ./drive.ts
opencode-drive start --name demo --script ./drive.ts
```

For a new script, run `opencode-drive script init ./drive.ts` once. It creates a
canonical Effect-native starter and refuses to overwrite an existing file.
`check` adds focused migration guidance when it finds Promise-style script
callbacks.

The script DSL applies `project`, `config`, `tuiConfig`, and `setup` with the same deterministic ordering described above. Automatic scripts run again after `opencode-drive restart --name demo`.

Use `launch: "manual"` only when the workflow must control server and TUI restarts itself. In manual mode `tui` and `ui` are `null`; run `server.launch()` before `tuis.launch(name)`. Only one server may run at a time, `server.kill()` permits relaunch, and a closed TUI name may be reused.

```ts
export default defineScript({
  launch: "manual",
  run: ({ server, tuis }) =>
    Effect.gen(function* () {
      yield* server.launch()
      const alice = yield* tuis.launch("alice", { recording: true })
      yield* alice.ui.screenshot("alice")
      yield* alice.close()
    }),
})
```

Cancellation uses Effect interruption. Interrupting the script or an
operation's fiber interrupts in-flight work and runs scoped finalizers; do not
introduce `AbortSignal` or Promise cancellation wrappers.

## Prepare An Instance

Use `init` only when files must be copied into an isolated home or project before a named live or scripted instance starts:

```bash
artifacts=$(opencode-drive init --name demo)
cp -R ./fixtures/home/. "$artifacts/"
cp -R ./fixtures/project/. "$artifacts/files/"
opencode-drive start --name demo --dev ~/projects/opencode
```

The simulated project is under `$artifacts/files`. A later `start --name demo` reuses the prepared artifacts; otherwise `start` initializes them automatically.

Drive uses an in-memory OpenCode database by default. For a script that restarts
the OpenCode service and must recover the same sessions, set
`OPENCODE_DRIVE_DB` to a file-backed path. Relative paths resolve inside the
isolated run's OpenCode data directory:

```bash
OPENCODE_DRIVE_DB=restart.sqlite \
  opencode-drive start --name restart-demo --script ./restart.ts
```

## Live Interaction

Use live commands to inspect or iterate on a persistent instance. Headless `start` requires a unique `--name`; visible instances may omit it. Headless `start` detaches after the instance is ready, so do not add `&`. Always stop the instance when finished.

```bash
opencode-drive start --name demo

opencode-drive send --name demo \
  --command.ui.type '{"text":"Explain this project"}' \
  --command.ui.enter

opencode-drive send --name demo --command.ui.state
opencode-drive send --name demo --command.ui.capture
opencode-drive send --name demo --command.ui.screenshot
opencode-drive stop --name demo
```

Image commands have one simple distinction:

- `--command.ui.capture` prints the raw terminal frame as JSON.
- `--command.ui.screenshot` saves that frame as a PNG and prints its absolute path.

Drive chooses the PNG directory. Do not configure a media directory or expect the OpenCode endpoint to provide one. Run `--command.ui.screenshot` as its own `send` invocation when the path is needed on stdout; a multi-command batch reports only whether the batch succeeded.

`send` executes command flags from left to right. JSON-valued commands take one JSON argument. Supported commands are:

- `--command.ui.type '{"text":"..."}'`
- `--command.ui.press '{"key":"p","modifiers":{"ctrl":true}}'`
- `--command.ui.enter`
- `--command.ui.arrow '{"direction":"down"}'`
- `--command.ui.focus '{"target":12}'`
- `--command.ui.click '{"target":12,"x":4,"y":1}'`
- `--command.ui.resize '{"cols":120,"rows":40}'`
- `--command.ui.screenshot` or `--command.ui.screenshot '{"name":"home"}'`
- `--command.ui.state`
- `--command.ui.snapshot`
- `--command.ui.capture`
- `--command.ui.matches '{"text":"OpenCode"}'`
- `--command.ui.recording.finish`

Use `meta` for the terminal Alt modifier. For example:
`--command.ui.press '{"key":"down","modifiers":{"meta":true}}'`.

Start with `--record` to record a headless live instance. `stop` finishes the recording, exports the MP4, performs owner cleanup, and prints the path.

Add `--keypress-overlay` when the video should show KeyCastr-style pills for
the agent's semantic hotkeys, Enter presses, and arrow navigation. It requires
`--record`; batched typed text is deliberately omitted.

```bash
opencode-drive start --name demo --record --keypress-overlay
opencode-drive stop --name demo
```

`dir` prints a live instance's artifact directory, and `list` lists active instances:

```bash
opencode-drive dir --name demo
opencode-drive list
```

## Prune

`prune` removes inactive artifact directories. To remove one instance's artifacts, pass the instance name supplied to `init` or `start`, not the generated `run-*` artifact directory name:

```bash
opencode-drive prune --name demo

# Force removal of all artifact directories, including active ones.
opencode-drive prune --force
```
